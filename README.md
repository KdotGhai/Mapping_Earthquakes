# Mapping_Earthquakes
## Module 13 [Map Visual Here](https://kdotghai.github.io/Mapping_Earthquakes/)

## OverView
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The utilization of maps allows us to explore, understand, and make decisions about our world in real time based upon stored data of the past event in databases/APIâ€™s. In this repository we will use javascript (GeoJSON) to create interactive maps to visualize earthquake data. GeoJSON data can be found in many apps that have a map feature such as ride-sharing, navigation, food and package delivery services, and even topography. While also providing location services on smart phones, tablets, laptops, any smart device that can display GeoSJON format/data.

## Results
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each earthquake is visually represented by a circle and color, where a higher magnitude will have a larger diameter and will be darker in color. In addition, each earthquake has a popup marker that, when clicked, shows the magnitude of the earthquake and the location of the earthquake. The map has three views:
-	Street View
-	Satellite View
-	Dark View
